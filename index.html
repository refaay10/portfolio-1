<p>
    A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car 
    enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes 
    for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on
    . The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any
     country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK.[1]
